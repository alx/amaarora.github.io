I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Weights & Biases, where I experiment with latest research papers in the field of Computer Vision in PyTorch. I also publicly write about these experiments [here](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/pytorch-image-models/reportlist?workspace=user-aarora).

I am interested in making deep learning more accessible to everybody and as part of that, a lot of my time is also spent in contributing to open source projects such as [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/) and [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/).

I am also self-taught - thanks to the wonderful [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course.
