I work as **Data Science Lead** at [REA Group](https://www.rea-group.com/), where we work with Property data, text and images. A part of my job is to experiment with the latest research and as part of this blog post, I document my learnings as I go.

I am interested in making deep learning more accessible to everybody and as part of that, a lot of my time is also spent in contributing to open source projects such as [TIMM](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/) and [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/).

I am also self-taught - thanks to the wonderful [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course.
