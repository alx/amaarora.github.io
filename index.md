I am also involved in hosting fortnightly paper reading groups at W&B, refer [here](https://wandb.ai/site/paper-reading-group) for more details. 

You will often see me writing about explaining research papers (mostly in the field of Computer Vision) in theory along with their PyTorch Implementation. Please feel free to [subscribe](https://amaarora.github.io/subscribe) to receive regular updates regarding new blog posts.
