# (TIMM SERIES) ViT - AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE

This blog is the beginning of some **truly exciting times** - want to know why? 

1. This is the first blog in the newly announced [TIMM SERIES](https://twitter.com/amaarora/status/1350410770052313088) and over time we will be covering off **all the models** that exist in one of my favourite libraries - [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models), used by thousands all over the world. Thanks [Ross Wightman](https://twitter.com/wightmanr) for creating such a wonderful library! 

> This means that not only would we be looking at the architectures in detail, but we will also understand how they are implemented in [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models), thus, looking at the code implementation too!

2. Welcome [Dr Habib Bukhari](https://twitter.com/dr_hb_ai)! You might know of him as [DrHB](https://www.kaggle.com/drhabib) on Kaggle - currently ranked **186/154,204** on the Kaggle ranking system! I am sure we all knew that he is great at deep learning but did you also know that he can also do some kickass visualizations to explain complicated concepts easily? And that, we have decided to team up for this and many more future blog posts to explain the concepts in an easy and visual manner. Together, we hope that you like what you read and see! Much effort and planning has gone into writing this blog post.

> To be honest, when Dr Habib first reached out to me and shared his visualizations - the first word that came out of my mouth was "Wow"! As you will see in this blog post and many more future ones, it's much better to have him do the visualizations than my scribblings using the iPad in my previous posts. Thank you Dr Habib for contributing to this blog and making it even better. :)

So, let's get started! This blog post has been structured in the following way:

## Prerequisite
In this blog post, I assume that the reader knows about the [Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). While it will be introduced briefly as part of this post, our main focus will on understanding how the authors of [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) from Google Brain applied the [Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to computer vision. 

Here are some of my personal favourite resources on Transformers:
1. [The illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) by Jay Alammar
2. [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) by Harvard NLP 
3. [Introduction to the Transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFkGPmU16QA&list=PLtmWHNX-gukKocXQOkQjuVxglSDYWsSh9&index=18&t=0s) by Rachel Thomas and Jeremy Howard

Though the next one is a biased recommendation, I would also like to recommend the reader to my previous post [The Annotated GPT-2](https://amaarora.github.io/2020/02/18/annotatedGPT2.html), for further reading on Transformers.

## Introduction
At the time of release, the [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) has received quite a bit of "attention" from the community. This was the first paper to get some astonishing results on the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/) using the **Transformer architecture**. While there had been attempts made in the past to apply Transformers in the context of image processing ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05751), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05909), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07853)), the Vision Transformer was one of the first to apply Transformers to full-sized images. 

**NOTE:** I will be using the terms `Vision Transformer` & `ViT` interchangeably throughout this blog post and both refer to architecture described in [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) paper.


## Key Contributions
The key contributions from this paper were not in terms of a new architecture, but rather the application of an existing architecture (Transformers), to the field of Computer Vision. It is the **training method** and the **dataset used to pretrain the network**, that were key for **ViT** to get excellent results compared to SOTA (State of the Art) on ImageNet.

So, there aren't a lot of new things to introduce in this post, but rather how to use the existing Transformer architecutre and apply it to Computer Vision. Thus, if the reader knows about **Transformers**, this blog post and the research paper itself should be a fairly simple read.

## Overall Method
We will be using a top down approach to understand the **Visual Transformer** architecture. We will first start by looking at the overall method and then dig deeper into each of the five steps in the overall method.

As an overall method, from the paper: 
>  We split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed each of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable “classification token” to the sequence. The illustration of the Transformer encoder was inspired by Vaswani et al. (2017)

![](/images/ViT.png "fig-1 The Model Overview")

The overall method can be described easily in five simple steps below:
1. Split an input image into patches.
2. Get linear embeddings (representation) from each patch referred to as **Patch Embeddings**.
3. Add position embeddings and a `[cls]` token to each of the Patch Embeddings. 
4. Pass through a **Transformer Encoder** and get the output values for each of the `[cls]` tokens.
5. Pass the representations of `[cls]` tokens through a `MLP` network to get final class predictions.

Not as descriptive? Enter *Dr Habib* to the rescue.

![](/images/vit-01.png "fig-2 Simplified Model Overview")

Let's now look at the five steps again with the help of `fig-2`. Let's image that we want to classify a `3` channel (RGB) input image of a frog of size `224 x 224`. 

The **first step** is to create patches all over the image of size `16 x 16`. Thus we create `14 x 14` or `196` such patches. We can have these patches in a straight line as in `fig-2`. As can be seen from the figure, the patch size is `3 x 16 x 16` where `3` represents the number of channels (RGB).

In the **second step**, we pass these patches through a **linear projection layer** to get `1 x 768` long vector representation for each of the patches shown in purple in the figure. In the paper, the authors refer to these representations of the patches as **Patch Embeddings**. Can you guess what's the size of this patch embedding matrix? It's `196 x 768`. Because we had a total of `196` patches and each patch has been represented as a `1 x 768` long vector.

> You might wonder why is the vector length `768`? Well, `3 x 16 x 16 = 768`. So, we are not really losing any information as part of this process of getting these **patch embeddings**.

In the **third step**, we take this patch embedding matrix of size `196 x 768` and similar to [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), the authors add a `[class]` token to this sequence of embedded patches and also add **Position Embeddings**. As we will see when we dig deeper into this step later in this post, the size of patch embedding matrix now becomes `197 x 768` due to the `[class]` token being added and also the size of the position embedding matrix is `197 x 768`.

> Why do we add this class token and position embeddings? You will find a detailed answer in the original Transformer and Bert papers, but to answer briefly, the `[class]` tokens are added as a special tokens whose outputs from the `Transformer Encoder` serve as the overall image patch representation. And we add the positional embeddings to retain the positional information of the patches. The Transformer model on it's own does not know about the order of the patches unlike CNNs, thus we need to manually inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the patches.

In the **fourth step**, we pass these preprocessed patch embeddings with positional information and prepended `[class]` tokens to the **Transformer Encoder** and get the learned embeddings of the `[class]` token. Thus the output representation would be of size `[1 x 768]` which are then fed to the MLP network as part of the final **fifth step** to get class predictions depending on the number of classes.

## Patch Embeddings
In this section we will be looking at **steps one and two** in detail. That is the process of getting patch embeddings from an input image.

![](/images/vit-02.png "fig-3 Patch Embeddings")

So far in the blog post I have mentioned that the way we get patch embeddings from an input image is to first split an image into fixed-size patches and then linearly embed each one of them using a **linear projection layer** as shown in `fig-2`. 

But, it is actually possible to combine both steps into a single step using **2D Convolution** operation. It is also better from an implementation perspective to do it this way as our GPUs are optimized to perform the convolution operation and it takes away the need to first split an image into patches. Let's see why this works?

If we set the the number of `out_channels` to `768`, and both `kernel_size` & `stride` to `16`, then as shown in `fig-3`, once we perform the convolution operation (where the 2-D Convolution has kernel size `3 x 16 x 16`), we can get the **Patch Embeddings** matrix of size `196 x 768` like below:

```python
# input image `B, C, H, W`
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
# 2D conv
conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 768, 16, 16)
conv(x).reshape(-1, 196).transpose(0,1).shape

>> torch.Size([196, 768])
```

## `[class]` token & Position Embeddings
In this section, let's look at the **third step** in more detail. In this step, we add `[class]` tokens and **Positional Embeddings** to the **Patch Embeddings**.

From the paper: 
> Similar to BERT’s [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embedded patches, whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (referred to as **Z<sub>L</sub><sup>0</sup>**) serves as the image representation. Both during pre-training and fine-tuning, a classification head is attached to **Z<sub>L</sub><sup>0</sup>**. 

Position embeddings are also added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use standard learnable 1D position embeddings and the resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.

let's understand this with the help of another visualization.

![](/images/vit-03.png "fig-4 `CLS` token and Position Embeddings")

As can be seen from `fig-4`, the `[class]` token is a vector of size `1 x 768`. We **prepend** it to the Patch Embeddings, thus the updated size of patch embedding matrix becomes `197 x 768`. Next, we **add** a **Positional Embedding** matrix of size `197 x 768` to the updated patch embedding matrix to get combined embeddings which are then ready to be fed to the `Transformer Encoder`.

## The Transformer Encoder
In this step, we will be looking at all the magic that goes inside the Transformer Encoder in **step-4**. This section of the blog is not particularly related to just Vision Transformers but explains the Transformer Encoder in general. To understand this section well, I refer the reader to resources mentioned in the Prerequisite section if you're not fully aware about the **Transformer Architecture**.

![](/images/vit-04.png "fig-5 The Transformer Encoder")

We already know how to get the **combined embeddings** which are fed to the Transformer Encoder as input. Next, as is usual, we use `Layer Norm` to normalize the matrix and pass it through a Linear Layer to get an output `qkv` matrix of shape `197 * 2304 (768 * 3 = 2304)`. Next, we reshape this matrix to get a new matrix of size `197 x 3 x 768` which can be further reshaped to `197 x 3 x 12 x 64`. 

> The `197 x 3 x 768` matrix consists of three matrices of `197 x 768` each of which represents `q`, `k` & `v` matrix. Next, you might ask, why do we then further reshape to `197 x 3 x 12 x 64`? This is to account for the 12 Attention Heads. This concept has been explained very well in section 3.2.2 of the [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper.

Next, we perform the actual **attention** operation which is described using the equation below: 

![](/images/attention.png "eq-1 Self-Attention")

as shown in `fig-5`, we use the `q`, `k` and `v` matrices to get the output matrix of size `197 x 768` which normalized using **Layer Norm** to get the final outputs of size `197 x 768` which are then fed to the MLP head.

> I purposely do not go into greater depth of the attention mechanism and the inner workings of the Transformer Encoder as this has been mentioned in the Prerequisite section of this post. Any of the resources should provide you with an excellent understanding of this process.

## The Vision Transformer
Inside the Vision Transformer, the authors in `ViT-Base` used 12 **Transformer Encoder** Layers and the complete architecture can be visualized as below:

![](/images/vit-06.png "fig-6 The Vision Transformer")

Given an input image, we already know how to get the **combined embeddings** from [here](). Once we have the combined embeddings, they are passed through a Transformer Encoder consisting of 12 layers. We have already looked at all the magic that goes on inside each layer in the previous section.

Finally, as we already know that the output from the **MLP** is of shape `197 x 768` which consists of the `[class]` tokens representation, we grasp these learned `[class]` token representations from the 12th Encoder layer to get a vector of shape `[1 x 768]` which is then fed to a classifier that is a Linear layer of shape `[768 * n_class]` to get the final class predictions.

And that's the Vision Transformer in all it's entirety! :)
